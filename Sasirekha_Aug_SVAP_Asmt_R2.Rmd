## World Happiness Report Analysis
## Happiness and Open data

-  1st part - Is happiness correlated with open data?.
-  2nd part - Are open countries happy countries?.
-  3rd part - Happiness Trends
-  4th part - What other measures are correlated with "Openness"?
-  5th part - Which factor does the happiness score depends upon ?

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
